<br><br>
 
<font color=#2554C7 face=tahoma><h3>Coorg or Kodagu History</h3></font>
<p>
	
	
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early accounts of Coorg are purely legendary, and it was not till the 9th and 10th centuries that its history became the subject of authentic record. At this period, according to inscriptions, the country was ruled by the Gangas, under whom the Changalvas, kings of Changa-nad, styled later kings of Nanjarayapatna or Nanjarajapatna, held the east and part of the north of Coorg, together with the Hunsur talk in Mysore. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the overthrow in the 11th century, of the Ganga power by the Cholas, the Changalvas became tributary to the latter. When the Cholas in their turn were driven from the Mysore country by the Hoysalas, in the 12th century, the Changalvas held out for independence; but after a severe struggle they were subdued and became vassals of the Hoysala kings. In the 14th century, after the fall of the Hoysala rule, they passed under the supremacy of the Vijayanagar empire.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1832, evidence of treasonable designs on the rajas part led to inquiries on the spot by the British resident at Mysore, as the result of which, and of the rajas refusal to amend his ways, a British force marched into Coorg in 1834, On the 11th of April the raja was deposed by Colonel Fraser, the political agent with the force, and on the 7th of May the state was formally annexed to the East India Companys territory. In 1852 the raja, who had been deported to Vellore, obtained leave to visit England with his favorite daughter Gauramma, to whom he wished to give a European education. On the 3oth of June she was baptized, Queen Victoria being one of her sponsors; she afterwards married a British officer who, after her death in 1864, mysteriously disappeared together with their child. Vira Raja himself died in 1863, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The so-called Coorg rebellion of 1837 was really a rising of the Gaudas, due to the grievance felt in having to pay taxes in money instead of in kind. A man named Virappa, who pretended to have escaped from the massacre of 1820, tried to take advantage of this to assert his claim to be raja, but the Coorgs remained loyal to the British and the attempt failed. In 1861, after the Mutiny, the loyalty of the Coorgs was rewarded by their being exempted from the Disarmament Act. </p>

Leaves grown in the wild are plucked and soaked (some boil) in water to get the aromatic juice, which has a thick and unique flavour in dark violet colour. Women make cakes out of the juice and also sweet porridge. The belief is that the plants contain 18 types of medicine. On the 18th day of "Kakkada", the plants start emitting a sweet aroma that is not found on them earlier. The aroma starts waning after the 18th day.</p>
